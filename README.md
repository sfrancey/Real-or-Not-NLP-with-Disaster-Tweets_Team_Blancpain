## Objectif of the Project 🕵️

Our challenge is to build a Machine Learning Model that aim to predict which tweets are about a real disaster and which are not. 

To do so, we have access to a dataset of 6,471 tweets classified between real disasters (1) and not real disasters (0).

Our results are compared among all teams involved in this competition in order to get the best prediction possible. 

## Project Structure 🚀

Step 1: Load and visualize (EDA) 
- import the initial database 
- describe database 
- highlight distribution among features 

Step 2: Base rate of the initial database 

Step 3: Bases benchmark accuracies: train the model on the original dataset without any modification (basic model)
- using "Keyword" feature 
- using Tweeets, "text" feature 
- combining both Keywords and tweets features
--> Startegic conclusion 

Step 4: Improvement of our ML Model: data cleaning 
- Cleaning keywords
- Cleaning Tweets 
--> Interative structure 

Step 5: Develop modeling 
- logistic regression 
- kNN method 
- decision trees 

Step 6: Results presentation
